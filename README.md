# HardMode
HardMode is a module heavily inspired by [mod-challenge-modes](https://github.com/ZhengPeiRu21/mod-challenge-modes). The purpose of this module is to develop extra functionality with a difference in code architecture. This makes it easier for me to develop on existing or expanding modes.

This module is still a WIP.

## Features
- **Self-Crafted Mode**
  - You can only equip and use items crafted by the player.
- **HardCore Mode**
   - Dying means you get sent to the shadow realm (permadeath).
- **SlowXP Mode**
   - Your kill and quest exp is reduced to 1x rates.

Read the `mode-restrictions.txt` file for a list of restrictions.
## ⚠️ Attention ⚠️
You _must_ enable `EnablePlayerSettings` in the World config to use this module.
