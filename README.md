# HardMode
HardMode is a module heavily inspired by [mod-challenge-modes](https://github.com/ZhengPeiRu21/mod-challenge-modes). The purpose of this module is to develop extra functionality with a difference in code architecture. This makes it easier for me to develop on existing or expanding modes.

This module is still a WIP.

## Features
- Build your own HardModes using the [restriction builder](https://anchydev.github.io/HardMode/#mode-editor).
- Level based rewards for each mode you have created.
- Dynamic auras for each mode.

## Database
Head over to my HardMode editor to create your first mode: https://anchydev.github.io/HardMode/#mode-editor

## Credits
Thanks to [ZhengPeiRu21](https://github.com/ZhengPeiRu21) for creating the original module which inspired this one.
